I am a **Post-Doctoral researcher** in the [Explainable Machine Learning](https://www.eml-munich.de/) group at TUM and Helmholtz Munich, led by Prof. [Zeynep Akata](https://www.eml-munich.de/people/zeynep-akata). 

I am also a PhD cadidate in the [Computer Vision group](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/) at the University of Freiburg, Germany, under the supervision of Prof. [Thomas Brox](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/brox/). Expected graduation in May 2025 - [website](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/bravoma/).


## Research interests
======
My research focuses on advancing vision-language models for open-vocabulary recognition and generative evaluation. I am particularly interested in the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, with a focus on developing models that can understand and generate visual content in a more human-like manner. 

  - Vision-Language Understanding: Integration of visual and linguistic information for multimodal reasoning.
  - Open-Vocabulary Recognition: Recognition of objects and attributes beyond predefined categories, including fine-grained attributes like color, texture, and material.
  - Human-Aligned AI: Development of AI systems that align with human preferences for improved interaction and collaboration, including building user studies to validate this alignment.
  - AI Generation: Advancing image and text generation, with a focus on aligning both modalities effectively.
  - Dataset, benchmark, and evaluation: Creating datasets and benchmarks for evaluating the performance of vision-language models.
  - Weakly-Supervised and Multimodal Learning: Leveraging weakly supervised learning for grounding visual and textual data.
  - Semantic Segmentation: Developing techniques for pixel-level classification in images and videos.
  - Video Object Segmentation: Advancing the segmentation of objects in dynamic video content.
  - Biomedical Image Processing: Applying AI techniques to analyze and interpret medical images.

## Biography
I am a Colombian researcher with a background in computer vision, artificial intelligence and biomedical engineering.

I (will) hold a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Freiburg, Germany, where I am part of the [Computer Vision Group](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/) led by Prof. [Thomas Brox](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/brox/). My research focuses on vision-language models, particularly in open-vocabulary recognition and generative evaluation.

During my PhD I did an internship at Amazon in T√ºbingen, where I worked on Vision-Language alignment and Generative AI with [Betty Mohler](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fjAWIaAAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Ali Jahanian](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nMpyjcwAAAAJ&hl=en). 

During 2019 I had the opportunity to work as a research intern at KAUST at the Image and Video Understanding Laboratory ([IVUL](https://ivul.kaust.edu.sa/)), working on Video Object Segmentation.

Before that I obained my Master's degree at the [Biomedical Computer Vision Group](https://biomedicalcomputervision.uniandes.edu.co) led by Pablo Arbel√°ez at the Universidad de los Andes in Bogot√°, Colombia. 

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and another in Biomedical Engineering from the Universidad de los Andes in Bogot√°, Colombia.
