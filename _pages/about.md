I am a **Post-Doctoral researcher** in the [Explainable Machine Learning](https://www.eml-munich.de/) group at TUM and Helmholtz Munich, led by Prof. [Zeynep Akata](https://www.eml-munich.de/people/zeynep-akata). 

I am also a PhD cadidate in the [Computer Vision group](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/) at the University of Freiburg, Germany, under the supervision of Prof. [Thomas Brox](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/brox/). Expected graduation in May 2025 - [website](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/bravoma/).

My research focuses on advancing vision-language models for open-vocabulary recognition and generative evaluation. I am particularly interested in the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, with a focus on developing models that can understand and generate visual content in a more human-like manner. 

During my PhD I did an internship at Amazon in Tübingen, where I worked on Vision-Language alignment and Generative AI with [Betty Mohler](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fjAWIaAAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Ali Jahanian](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nMpyjcwAAAAJ&hl=en). 

During 2019 I had the opportunity to work as a research intern at KAUST at the Image and Video Understanding Laboratory ([IVUL](https://ivul.kaust.edu.sa/)), working on Video Object Segmentation.

Before that I obained my Master's degree at the [Biomedical Computer Vision Group](https://biomedicalcomputervision.uniandes.edu.co) led by Pablo Arbeláez at the Universidad de los Andes in Bogotá, Colombia.
